# Amicable-numbers
Let  be defined as the sum of proper divisors of  (numbers less than  which divide evenly into ). If  and , where , then  and  are an amicable pair and each of  and  are called amicable numbers.  For example, the proper divisors of  are  therefore . The proper divisors of  are  so .  Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under .
